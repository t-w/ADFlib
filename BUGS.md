## Possible bugs
- in dircache updates


## Write support
Recent issues:

- Versions 0.9.0 and earlier - bug on file appending on OFS (not updated data
  size in OFS data block header if written data chunk is bigger than space
  remaining in the block)
  - not the most common case and it does not cause any harm on reading/writing
    with ADFlib only - but on systems where OFS data block header information
	is used	(AmigaOS), it may lead to errors and loss of data

- Versions 0.8.0 and ealier **do not check or rebuild the block allocation
  bitmap for volumes where it is marked invalid**. This means that if
  the bitmap is really incorrect, writing to such volume may lead to data
  loss/corruption (blocks used by stored data might not be marked as such!).


## Past security bugs

(found in Debian version `unadf/0.7.11a-3`, fixed in versions `unadf/0.7.11a-4`,
`unadf/0.7.11a-3+deb8u1`). See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=838248
